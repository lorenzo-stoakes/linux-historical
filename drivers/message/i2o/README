Promise
	Providing a Supertrak 100 board and support info

DPT
	Providing a DPT smartraid I2O card (use dpt_i2o for this
	board however)

STATUS:
o	Should be stable for x86 32bit

KNOWN ISSUES:

o	Some promise cards need firmware updates

TO DO:

General:
o	Finish 64bit and big endian cleanup
o	Switch to new PCI mapping layer throughout
o	Hotswap of controllers
o	Provide hidden address space if asked
o	Long term message flow control
o	PCI IOP's without interrupts are not supported yet
o	Push FAIL handling into the core
o	DDM control interfaces for module load etc

Block:
o	Multiple major numbers (problem goes away in 2.5)
o	Power management
o	Finish Media changers

SCSI:

Lan:	
o	Performance tuning
o	Test Fibre Channel code

Tape:
o	Anyone seen anything implementing this ?
